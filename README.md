I am a junior **psychology** major at Bowdoin College. 
## I love to learn new languages, cook, and spend time outdoors!
I have been spending lots of time on the [coglab](https://teaching-me.github.io/coglab/) website for my class this year.
Some things I want to do this week:
1. Go for a run in the Brunswick Commons
2. Shop at TJ's
3. Make the Pillsbury Halloween themed cookies
